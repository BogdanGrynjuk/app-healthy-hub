# HealthyHub

HealthyHub is a web application designed to help users track their daily health
habits, including hydration and meal tracking. The app offers an intuitive
interface to log water intake, record meals, set goals, and monitor progress
over time.

## Problems Addressed

HealthyHub addresses several key health challenges faced by users:

1. **Insufficient Water Intake**: Many individuals struggle to meet their daily
   hydration needs. The app allows users to track their water consumption,
   ensuring they stay hydrated and maintain optimal health.
2. **Difficulties with Meal Tracking**: Changing dietary habits can be
   overwhelming. HealthyHub simplifies the process of logging meals, providing
   customizable options that help users manage their nutrition effectively.

   track with their health goals.

   maintain their current weight, or gain muscle, HealthyHub allows for
   personalized goal setting, helping users stay focused and accountable on
   their health journey.

   easy-to-navigate application is crucial. HealthyHub provides a clean and
   intuitive interface that makes it simple for anyone to log their hydration
   and meals, regardless of their tech-savviness.
